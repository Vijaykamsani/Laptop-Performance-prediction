# Laptop-Performance-prediction
LAPTOP PERFORMANCE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING WITH INCREASE IN TECHNOLOGY


The main significance of the project is that if any user wants to buy a Laptop then our application should be compatible to provide a tentative performance of Laptop according to the user configurations.  The dataset always will noisy and needs lots of feature engineering, and preprocessing that will drive your interest in developing this project.
